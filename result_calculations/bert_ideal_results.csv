a1c was approximately 13,"poorly controlled hypertension with no known coronary artery disease now presenting for cardiovascular clearance prior to elective hip repair scheduled for three days from now. this gentleman has no known coronary disease and has a reasonable exercise capacity, which i estimate to be 3 to 5 mets. most recently, given his hip and orthopedic issues, he has been unable to ambulate even to three mets. however, prior to his orthopedic injury several months ago, he was able to ambulate up two flights of steps with only minimal dyspnea upon reaching the top step and without any exertional chest discomfort. however, given his multiple risk factors, notably his poorly controlled diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension as well as former tobacco use, he certainly is at very high risk for obstructive coronary disease. as such, i recommended we obtain a persantine pet stress test for tomorrow morning. if this test is normal without any high risk features or without any evidence for obstructive coronary disease, it would be reasonable for him to proceed with surgery later on this week. this test will also suffice for his upcoming gastric laparoscopic bypass surgery, which is scheduled for 01 / 2074. with regards to his medication, his blood pressure still is not at goal below 130. as such, i have increased his toprol - xl from 125 mg to 200 mg p. o. daily. this medication should be continued through all surgery. additionally, if this is not sufficient in bringing his blood pressure down below 130, i would recommend the addition of a diuretic to his regimen either lasix 20 mg p. o. daily or hydrochloroth",0,0.25,0.0037174721189591076,0.007326007326007325
