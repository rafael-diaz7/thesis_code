      "0314 , at 24 weeks , now with severe\n",
      "frontal headache and scintillations. Dating is by the last\n",
      "menstrual period and an early ultrasound which placed her at\n",
      "approximately 24 weeks. She presented with a three and a half day\n",
      "history of severe frontal headaches with scintillations. There was\n",
      "no relief with Tylenol , aspirin or Fioricet. She also stated she\n",
      "had marked polydipsia for four days. She denied abdominal pain or\n",
      "swelling. She has a history of preeclampsia with a previous twin\n",
      "gestation. She does note fetal activity. At this juncture , I\n",
      "should note that much of this history is as per patient and is\n",
      "somewhat unreliable. PAST OBSTETRICAL HISTORY: C-section for\n",
      "twins; previous C-section for singleton; history by patient of\n",
      "preeclampsia. PAST HISTORY: Initially she admitted to no past\n",
      "medical problems , however , upon reviewing her chart the following\n",
      "is obvious: chronic hypertension; seizure disorder following motor\n",
      "vehicle accident for which she is on valproic acid , no clearly\n",
      "documented recent seizures; history of asthma for which she takes\n",
      "medicines p.r.n.; history of behavioral disorders with question of\n",
      "pseudoseizures in the past; obesity; multiple drug allergies;\n",
      "cholecystectomy in 1990; appendectomy at age 14; motor vehicle\n",
      "accident with V-P shunt placement in 1980; facial reconstruction\n",
      "times three in 1980; superficial vascular surgery in 1989 for\n",
      "varicosities of the lower extremities. SOCIAL HISTORY: She denies\n",
      "tobacco , ethanol or drug use.\n",
      "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Revealed an obese white female in mild\n",
      "distress. The pupils are equal , round and\n",
      "reactive to light and accommodation; fundi well visualized , no\n",
      "papilledema. Good facial movements. No oral lesions. The chest\n",
      "was clear. The heart showed a regular rate and rhythm. The\n",
      "abdomen was soft and nontender with a fetal heart rate in the\n",
      "140's. The extremities showed trace edema. The neuro exam showed\n",
      "cranial nerves II-XII grossly intact. Reflexes were 1+ without\n",
      "clonus. The strength was reduced to 4/5 in the right upper and\n",
      "right lower extremities , however , the exam was questionable as she\n",
      "seemed to have a varying exam depending on the examiner and time of\n",
      "exam. She also demonstrated decreased fine finger movements on the\n",
      "right.\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE: Problem #1 ) Headache. The patient has a history\n",
      "of chronic headaches for which she was maintained\n",
      "on Fioricet in the past. Over the first week of hospitalization ,\n",
      "she complained of increasing headache that prevented her from\n",
      "looking into the light as well as prevented her from ambulating out\n",
      "of the bed. At times , she complained of intermittent visual\n",
      "symptoms. These headaches were not completely relieved by Demerol ,\n",
      "Percocet or Tylenol. She was eventually tried on Fioricet which\n",
      "apparently produced good relief of the headaches. She was seen by\n",
      "neurology and noted with a questionably abnormal neuro exam with\n",
      "findings localized to the right side. Apparently she has a history\n",
      "of this abnormality in the past. A CT scan revealed what was\n",
      "apparently old damage from the previous motor vehicle accident. An\n",
      "MRI was entirely within normal limits. She refused a lumbar\n",
      "puncture. At this time , the headaches are thought to be either\n",
      "vascular in origin or psychogenic. She was continued on Fioricet\n",
      "at the time of discharge. Problem #2 ) Hypertension. She had\n",
      "elevated blood pressures of 150-160 over as high as 110 upon\n",
      "admission. She has a history of chronic hypertension in the past\n",
      "and was at least briefly maintained on hydrochlorothiazide before.\n",
      "She had a negative work up for PET , including repeat 24 hour urines\n",
      "and repeat PET labs. As well , she had no physical findings\n",
      "consistent with PET. Given her history of chronic hypertension , we\n",
      "felt this was most likely chronic hypertension aggravated by\n",
      "pregnancy. She was begun on a beta blocker , namely labetolol , with\n",
      "good control. She was discharged to home on labetolol. Problem\n",
      "#3 ) History of seizure disorder. She carries the diagnosis of a\n",
      "seizure disorder , although this is , at least recently , poorly\n",
      "documented. She has been on valproic acid in the past and has been\n",
      "taking a small dose of valproic acid apparently on her own\n",
      "throughout this pregnancy. She has been taking 250 mg a week. She\n",
      "last noted an obvious seizure three years ago. It is not clear\n",
      "that this was witnessed by anyone else. While in the hospital , she\n",
      "had an EEG which suggested some slowing in the right parietal\n",
      "region. There was no clear seizure activity seen on EEG. She\n",
      "called us to her room on several episodes which she described as\n",
      "seizures. These seizures were witnessed by several physicians and\n",
      "were remarkable for absence of a postictal period as well as\n",
      "abnormal idiosyncratic behaviors during the events. It was our\n",
      "feeling that these were not true seizures. Indeed , reviewing her\n",
      "chart , she has had episodes of what have been called pseudoseizures\n",
      "similar to these in the past. Given her multiple drug allergies ,\n",
      "including Dilantin , phenobarb and tegretol , we felt limited in our\n",
      "therapeutic options. We did elect to increase her dose of valproic\n",
      "acid as this has apparently been effective in the past. She will\n",
      "continue this as an outpatient. Problem #4 ) Nausea and vomiting.\n",
      "She complained of persistent nausea and vomiting during the latter\n",
      "part of her hospitalization and declined to take anything p.o. The\n",
      "etiology of this nausea and vomiting was unclear , although\n",
      "apparently associated with some diarrhea. As much as was possible ,\n",
      "work up for an organic cause of the problem was negative. We\n",
      "elected initially to treat her with intravenous hydration , however ,\n",
      "she declined further IV's. In fact , she became quite vocal in her\n",
      "demand to go home. She understands our concerns as to the risks of\n",
      "poor p.o. intake and insists she will be able to take in p.o.'s at\n",
      "home. Given her feelings in this regard , we have elected to\n",
      "discharge her for a trial of outpatient management. Follow up will\n",
      "be in the clinic. Should she show evidence of compromise or\n",
      "dehydration , she will be readmitted. Problem #5 ) Psychosocial.\n",
      "The patient has been seen several times in the past for behavioral\n",
      "disorders. It is difficult to sort out what part of her\n",
      "symptomatology is organic and what , if any , is inorganic. She was\n",
      "seen by psychiatry during her stay here who felt that she had a\n",
      "significant conflict in her home life. We have counseled her as\n",
      "much as possible throughout her stay. She has seen both social\n",
      "services and psychiatry , however , she is at best reluctant to avail\n",
      "herself of these services. Our plan at the time of discharge is\n",
      "for follow up with DSS. As well , we have emphasized our\n",
      "availability to the patient at all times and tried to be as\n",
      "supportive as possible in these circumstances.\n",
      "DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged for a trial of management\n",
      "at home. The etiology of her discomfort is somewhat\n",
      "obscure , however , we have as best as possible ruled out obvious\n",
      "major organic pathology , including PET , central CNS processes and\n",
      "fulminant hypertension.\n",

      "Record date: 2076-06-05CARDIOLOGYSABINE MEDICAL CENTERReason for visit:   Follow up: NSVT and history of VF ArrestInterval History:   Mr. Quijano returned for follow-up today. His last visit was in December 2075, following which he had a routine stress test. He had been planning to do some skiing over January, and we wanted to give him clearance to do so.His stress test was done on 1-4-76, and revealed mild apical ischemia. He completed 8 METs and had no symptoms during the test.  Based on these findings, we did not change any medications and encouraged him to continue with his usual activities.  Unfortunatley, he was never able to ski over January anyway due to a bout with pneumonia.He had also reported a vague sensation of shortness of breath that was occurring \"rarely\", but was correlated with the consumption of alcohol.  The frequency of these episodes has increased to 2-3 times per week. He says it is not really shortness of breath, but an awareness that something feels different. He is able to continue his usual activities, including his aerobics and pilates classes without difficulty.He denies any chest discomfort, palpitations, rapid heart action, dizziness or syncope.Past medical history:   DMII, CAD, s/p CABG, VF Arrest Hypercholesterolemia, 1st Degree AV block, RBBB, NSVTMedications (Confirmed):\t\t\tDalmane 30 mgglyburide 2.5mg po qdLipitor 20 mglisinopril 5 mg po qdmetformin hydrochloride 500 mgNexium 40mg po qdPhysical examination:-BP: 110/70  -Pulse: 50  -General:   No acute distress.-Skin:   No rashes, anicteric.-Heent:   Unremarkable-Neck:   Carotids 2+ without bruits. JVP no jugular venous distention.-Chest:   Clear to auscultation.-Cardiac:   Left ventricular impulse discrete and nondisplaced. Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, with no S3 or S4. There were no murmurs, clicks or rubs.-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds, soft and nontender, with no hepatosplenomegaly or masses appreciated.-Extremities:   No cyanosis, clubbing or edema. 2+ pedal pulses.EKG:   Sinus Bradycardia 50bpm, 1st degree AV block PR 290ms, RBBB. Compared to previous EKGs, PR interval is slightly longer.Assessment and plan:   Mr. Quijanno is doing well with the exception of these brief episodes of shortness of breath. I am encouraged that these events do not inhibit him from exercise. We have fitted him with a holter monitor today to further sort out any arrhythmogenic etiology of his symptoms.  We will discuss the findings over the phone on Wednesday of this week.The above plan was discussed with Dr. Kilian Middleton, who is in agreement.Ximena Mays, N.P. and Kilian Middleton, M.D.Changes to Medications this visitLipitor 20 mg    QTY:60 Refills:6 Start: 7/22/2072 1 tab po qdlisinopril 5 mg  po qd QTY:90 Refills:3 Start: 1/27/2075Nexium 40mg  po qd QTY:30 Refills:2 Start: 10/11/2075glyburide 2.5mg  po qd QTY:90 Refills:3 Start: 10/11/2072metformin hydrochloride 500 mg    QTY:360 Refills:1 year Start: 4/12/2071 2 tabs po bidDalmane 30 mg    QTY:30 Refills:2 Start: 5/2/66 take 1 at hs prnSigned electronically by   Ximena A Mays NP  on  Jun 5, 2076Record date: 2076-08-29August 29, 2076Dr. GalvanInternal Medicine AssociatesRM 309Re:  \tQuijano, Donny \tSMC Unit # 544-84-52Dear Dr. Galvan:I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Mr. Quijano, in followup for episodes of dyspnea, in the setting of asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, myasthenia gravis and distant coronary disease.He reports that his    spasms    of unpredictable exertional breathlessness have continued to be substantially in remission, occurring less than once a week and sometimes only every two weeks.  Swallowing is fine with fewer choking episodes when he drinks water, but no problem with the ingestion of other substances.  No cough, phlegm, lower extremity edema, chest pain or chest infections.No reflux symptoms.Sneezing spells and coryza, especially in the morning, have been most noticeable in the past several months.He enjoyed his trip to Romania, and had only two days when he had a couple of minor spells.Medications:  Advair, 100/50, one puff b.i.d. (continues the 10 second breath hold); lisinopril; atenolol; Mestinon; Metformin; no proton pump inhibitor.On examination, he is his usual fit-appearing self.  Blood pressure is 130/70, respiratory rate 18 and unlabored, heart rate 55 and regular.  Conjunctivae are clear.  Sinuses nontender.  Nasal passages are narrowed but without inflammation.  Oropharynx:  Mild crowding in the posterior pharynx, but there were no definite exudates.  No goiter or adenopathy.  Back:  Normal configuration.  Chest:  Normal percussion note, faint prolongation of the expiratory phase without definite wheezes.  Cardiac:  Vague cardiac impulse, 1/6 systolic mid to late systolic murmur at the apex, JVP 8 cm with borderline HJR, no S3.  Abdomen:  Soft, scaphoid, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly or mass.  Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Skin:  Well tanned.Pulmonary function tests today show regression of the FEV1 from 2.09 liters on 6/27 to 1.72 liters, similar to the 1.62 liter value of 6/13, with an FVC that has decreased from 3.47 on 6/27 to 2.8 liters now, although with an FET of only 8.5 versus 14.3.CT scan today, by my review - A tiny nodule in the extreme right apex, mildly thickened bronchi in the extreme left lower lobe, status post mediasternotomy with diffuse calcification of the coronary arteries.Impression:Episodic dyspnea due to asthma, with underlying excellent functional status and because of his stoicism and fitness, with the variability in pulmonary function on testing correlating well with a slight increase in the frequency of his occasional episodes, because of the asthma and allergies, he may benefit from Singulair.Probable mild occult gastroesophageal reflux.Ischemic coronary disease, status post VF arrest and revascularization.Myasthenia, mainly ocular.Prior Raynaud's syndrome.Recommendations:Continue Advair at the current dose.Trial of Singulair, 10 mg p.o. q. p.m.Low threshold for adding a proton-pump inhibitor and/or intranasal steroids.Continue exercise program.Return visit in three months with pulmonary function tests at that time.It has been a pleasure to participate in his care.Sincerely yours,Dean S.

The patient was in her usual state of poor health when she was noticed by caregivers to be confused and lethargic.  The patient was transferred to the emergency room department. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: MEDICATIONS:  Unknown medications at this time. ALLERGIES:  Sulfa and penicillin.  Aspirin and all cephalosporins. SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY: PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 101.6 degrees, pulse 90, respiratory rate 18, blood pressure 114/60, room air saturation 91%.  HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Neck supple and nontender. Chest:  Bibasilar crackles.  Left sided rhonchi.  Abdomen:  Obvious infected wound.  Minimally tender.  Extremities:  Negative. Neurologic:  Symmetric.  Alert and oriented times two.  Reflexes normal, strength normal. LABORATORY EVALUATION:  WBC 28. THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was given IV antibiotics and will be admitted to the medical service for workup. PROCEDURES: CONSULTATIONS (including PCP): FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Urosepsis. DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  She was admitted in poor condition. ___________________________________                    ZD548/6212                                                        D:10/21/65                                                        T:10/21/65 Dictated by:  RUBEN ZACARIAS, M.D.  RZ1  ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********Record date: 2066-01-20GRANITE COUNTY MEMORIALArthritis Department17 Weld St                             Bird, TerriLisbon, SD  52797                             80910690659-5187                                      1-20-66   Ms. Bird comes in today to follow up on her weight and blood sugar control, as well as to discuss her overall mental status and its effects on her living situation. PMH:  Her past medical history includes atrial fibrillation, status post renal allograft, status post aortic and mitral valve replacements with a mechanical valve, on chronic Coumadin, a recent aortic aneurysm repair and complications around that, including a cellulitis which has been treated, and now waxing and waning mental status.  She also is insulin-dependent diabetic.   MEDICATIONS:  Her medications currently include:1.   Neurontin 300 t.i.d.2.   Insulin NPH 20 units in the morning, 10 in the evening.3.   Fosamax each day.4.   Premarin and Provera.5.   Tums Extra-Strength.6.   digoxin 0.25 and 0125.7.   Mevacor 40 a day.8.   Coumadin 1mg each day, except Sunday 2mg.9.   Imuran 100mg a day.10.  prednisone 20mg every other day. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient notes that she has been feeling well and more active.  She is able to walk around her house without her walker.  She does use the walker outside of the house for safety and precaution.  She is independent in bathing and washing, as well as cooking and preparing meals.  She, however, is requiring a lot of assistance with managing her medications.  She has her daughter-in-law downstairs help her with this.  She has not been out of the house much in the last several months, and, while she wants to drive, no-one has allowed her to get behind the wheel.   The patient otherwise feels well with no chest pain, no shortness of breath, no change in her bowel or bladder. HABITS:  She has had a weight which has been stable, and her appetite has been good. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Notable for a well-appearing female who walks with a walker, slowly, but in no acute distress.  Her weight is 104 lbs.  Her blood pressure today is 130/72.  Her pulse is 80 and regular today.  She has no peripheral edema, and she is comfortable sitting in a chair.

She will continue on her current medications, as noted above.   The bulk of the discussion was regarding her home situation and her mental status.  She has clearly improved her mental status gradually over the last several months.  She is anxious to drive.  However, everyone in the family who is with her at the visit and her visiting nurse agree that she is not mentally sound enough to be behind a wheel.  I explained this in no uncertain terms, and also set a milestone in management of her own medications.  Hence, our three goals that we set today were:1.   Management of the patient's own medications, which she was doing      six months ago.2.   To get out of the house at least once a week, using either      community transportation or a family member.3.   To be doing the family's laundry each week. While the patient was not happy about being told that she could not drive, she understood the reasons and was satisfied with the goals that we set. Hence, I will see her back in about six weeks and see how she is doing with these goals.  As well, we will continue to have the visiting nurse see her every other week to monitor her blood sugar and Coumadin.   ______________________________Steve George, M.D.                                                     ft:ZO:1640                                                               DD:1-20-66                                                              DT:1-21-66                                                              DV:1-20-66                                                               ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********Record date: 2066-03-03GRANITE COUNTY MEMORIALArthritis Department93 Weld St                             BIRD, TERRILisbon, SD  52797                             80910690                                              3-03-66   ID: Mrs. Bird comes in today for a routine check-up.  She is a 70-year-old female with multiple medical problems including atrial fibrillation, status post renal allograft, status post MVR and AVR, on Coumadin now, history of CABG in the setting of her valve replacements, history of a recent aortic aneurysm repair with some mental status diminution after the surgery.  MEDICATIONS: Synthroid, Hydralazine, Lopressor, prednisone, Coumadin, Provera, NPH insulin, Neurontin 300mg t.i.d., Imuran 100mg a day, Zocor 20mg a day, and Digoxin 0.25 alternating with 0.125mg.  She is also taking Fosamax 10mg a day and Premarin 0.3mg a day.   The patient is followed closely by a visiting nurse at home.  Her blood pressure checks have all been 120-140/70-90 and her blood sugars have been running in the morning between 80 and 120 and in the evening from 150 all the way up to 450.  We have made some adjustments recently in her NPH morning dose, and hope to see if this will make a benefit.   Patient notes that she has been feeling generally well, that she has been able to fill her cassettes for her medicines, and overall manage her medicines without problems.  She does note that she is having some pain down her left leg, which she describes as her usual sciatica.  The patient has had this on multiple occasions, and it usually waxes and wanes over time.  The Neurontin in the past has been very helpful for this.  The patient denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, has had no fevers or weight loss recently, and has no dyspnea at nighttime.  PHYSICAL EXAM: Notable for a short female in no acute distress, who walks with a walker today.  Blood pressure: 144/76.  Pulse: 78 and regular.  Her lungs bilaterally are clear to auscultation.   Her heart is with sharp click during S1 and S2.  She has got a regular rate and rhythm today.  Her abdomen is soft, nontender, with no organomegaly.  She has got a well-healed abdominal scar. She has got no lower extremity edema.  Her musculoskeletal examination is notable for tenderness up into the sciatic notch on the left side.  She has got otherwise joints that move through a normal range of motion, no swelling or warmth. There is no evidence for ecchymoses or petechiae anywhere.   Today will check a hemoglobin A1C, a CBC, and a chem 7 for routine monitoring.  My overall impression is that Ms. Bird is doing quite well.   I will not make any changes to her medicines until I see her hemoglobin A1C.  I suggested that I could give her an injection for her sciatica, but I would rather wait because of her anticoagulation, and to see whether it remits on it's own.

She is clearly doing better from a mental status standpoint, as evidenced by her being able to manage her own medications.  I have discussed this issue at length with family and her nurse, and everybody is comfortable with her trying to drive with someone in the car with her.  I will talk to her son, Steven Bird, who lives downstairs, and see whether he or his wife could help with trying her out driving first in a schoolyard without any people there, and then on less-crowded roads, and then finally in a more regular situation.  We will try this over time and see how it works, and I will be involved in making any decisions as far as letting her drive on her own.    ______________________________Steve George, M.D.                                                     EH:UC:8398                                                               DD:3-03-66                                                              DT:3-04-66                                                              DV:3-03-66                                                               ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********Record date: 2067-01-12                                                             (550) 659-5187GRANITE COUNTY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL   January 13, 2067 Gwendolyn Irvine, M.D. Houghton Community Health Center Lyons StreetQueen Creek, SD 89544  RE:  Bird, Terri                                                    MRN: 80910690                                                             Dear Dr. Irvine: I had the chance today to see Terri Bird in follow-up, as her primary care physician. As you are well aware, she is 71-year-old female who resides currently at the Elm Hills Nursing Home where you have been taking care of her. I have not seen her now for the past ten months. For my records, I am going to summarize her medical history briefly. It includes a history of atrial fibrillation. She is status post an MVR with Duluth Clinic. She is on chronic anti-coagulation. She is status post a renal allograft for what is believed to be a history of strep glomerular nephritis. She has been on Imuran and Prednisone for several decades with no history of rejection. She also has a history of a CABG in the setting of her valve replacement. As well, she has a history of spinal stenosis, for which she has been treated intermittently with epidural steroid injection. About a year ago, she had an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair and in this setting developed some delirium and at that point was sent to rehab where she had a ankle fracture and a long recovery and she spent time at several different nursing homes and had a hip fracture as well as a recurrent ankle fracture and most recently has been with you at Elm Hills Nursing Home. I also have a discharge summary from a recent hospitalization where she had a pneumonia, a right middle lobe which was successfully treated with levofloxacin.  MEDICATIONS: Her current medications from the notes that I received include Premarin .3mg, Neurontin 300mg each day, Miacalcin nasal spray, Provera 2.5mg, Synthroid 25mcg, Digoxin 125mcg, Cardizem CD 180mg a day, Imuran 100mg a day, Lopressor 50mg twice a day, calcium carbonate 500mg three times a day, Isordil 3 times a day as well as Coumadin based on her INR. ALLERGIES: She has an allergy to penicillin as well as sulfur and cephalosporins and of note she had been on a tapering Prednisone dose which seems to have been stopped. As well, she is on sliding scale insulin and Humulin N, which seems to have been adjusted recently. RE:  Bird, Terri                                                    MRN: 80910690                                                           January 13, 2067Page 2  The patient was brought to me today by her family, because they were concerned that she was not getting optimal care. In talking to her, she says she feels quite well. She has no pain. She has no pain in her buttocks or her legs. She says her breathing feels well. She has no productive cough. She has no chest pain. She denies any peripheral edema. She notes that she is concerned that she is not getting enough exercise at Elm Hill Nursing Home, but otherwise feels like she is getting reasonable care. However, she does breakdown and cry about her current situation in that she is depressed about living in a nursing home.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On the exam today, her blood pressure is 122/70. She has a regular rate and rhythm on heart exam with a pulse of 72. She has sharp clicks over her chest. She has a soft abdomen with no organomegaly and a well healed scar. She has equal pulses bilaterally. She has got a normal skin exam with multiple skin tags. She has a full range of motion in her upper extremities as well as her hips, knees and ankles. She has a stooped gate and I watch her walk with her walker and she seems relatively stable. She is somewhat confused about the date and the place, but recognizes me and is able to articulate very clearly about her current situation at Elm Hills.  I have no laboratory data to speak of.  I had a long conversation with her and her husband as well as her son and daughter-in-law and explained my concerns with her overall safety and I thought that currently it would be unwise for her to be in an unsupervised setting. I thought that a nursing home is a reasonable place for her to be and suggested quite strongly to consider an antidepressant. It looks like you have had a psychiatrist evaluate her recently and I think it would be worthwhile, at least a month trial of SSRI, gradually titrating up the dose based on her side effects.  I am more than happy to see her intermittently to give her reassurance, but it seems like your care has been excellent and feel free to contact me with questions about her past history.  Sincerely,    Steve George, M.D.                                                     lb:TT:1489                                                              DD:1-13-67                                                               DT:1-13-67                                                                ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********Record date: 2069-02-17MD Connect Call 11:59pm 2/16/69 from Dr. Hale at Senior Care Clinic Queen Creek, SD regarding Terri Bird.  Patient admitted there 2/12/69 with CHF exacerbation with some associated COPD exacerbation and associated pneumonia.  All initially improved but then clinically worsening 2/14-2/16.  Patient requiring 100% NRB mask to maintain normal saturation with rising BUN/CR (hx kidney transplant).  Clinically showing pulmonary edema but no urine output to IV lasix.  Patient had established DNR status.  Request by family to Dr. Hale to transfer patient to GCM.  I spoke to MD, nurse, and daughter-in-law and offered to accept patient when she was medically stabilized.  I thought she was too ill to safely transfer at the time without intubation before-hand.  I called RN back at 6am and learned that patient had O2 saturation of 70%, pH=7.2 and covering MD had honored patient's established DNR order despite some family members desire to reverse it.  Patient too ill to transfer safely; will contact me again if patient stabilized.Al S. Everhart, MDHospitalist Service\n",

After which, the patient had a trip to Peru and ran out of her medication 2 days priory to her return. When she returned about a wk ago the patient presented to EW because of another episode of hypertensive  emergency, for which, she was D/C with a follow up with one of the HGH PCPs.

She was very scared.  No visual changes or other unusual sensations.  She hadn't been sick in any other way:  no fevers, chills, N/V, or other complaints. She felt a tiny bit better and was able to go to the door and let the EMTs in.  They checked her sugar:  63.  They gave her some sugar gel and her Sx resolved. In the ER, her Sx did not reappear.  Labs were notable for BS of 140 then 255.  (A1C on 12/27/66 was 7.8.)  Her Na+ was low @ 124 &amp; 126, but this is stable for her.    She had a normal MRI/MRA.

Patient states over the past 2 days she has felt confused and weak, citing that when someone would call she was unable to speak.  She also has felt unsteady on her feet and fell twice yesterday when out walking, hitting her face and arm.  She reports dizziness prior to fall but denies chest pain, palpitations or SOB.  There was no loss of consciousness and she was able to get up/ambulate after fall.  Of note, she has switched from drinking 7 cans of diet coke per day to 7 cans of regular coke because the facility where she lives ran out of diet coke.  She is also restricting her caloric intake and her meals consist of a croissant at breakfast, cottage cheese at lunch and an avocado for dinner, in attempt to lose weight.   She has not had any recent medication changes.  She denies recent fever, chills, CP, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria.  She does report significant thirst and frequent urination.  She also reports SOB with exertion, particularly walking up stairs.      In the ED initial VS were T 99.2  HR 98  BP 173/93  RR 22.  Labs were significant for a Na 118, K 3.5, Cl 82, CO2 17.5, AG 19, WBC 15, Hct 32.  CXR was clear.  She was given a total of 1L NS and free water restricted.

ASSESSMENT AND PLANMs. Ostrander is a 64 yo Peruvian woman with schizophrenia, HTN, DM2, HL presenting with confusion and found to have significant metabolic disarray including hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypochloremia and an anion gap.  She also has a mild leukocytosis, anemia &#8211; at baseline, and thrombocytosis.  ##: Hyponatremia &#8211; Calculated serum osmolality is 248 mOsm/L (measured 241) suggesting a hypotonic hyponatremia.  Clinically she appears euvolemic, despite having a dry mouth which may be from patient&#8217;s antipsychotics.   A Uosm of 62 is most suggestive of primary polydipsia vs. low solute.  Patient is drinking 2L coke/day and complaining of excessive thirst, per PCP/psych notes she is told to limit fluids to 1L.  Interestingly this may have been precipitated by switching from diet coke to coke as diet coke contains 30mg Na and 0gm carbs while regular coke contains 45mg Na and 39gm carbohydrates.  Increased carbohydrates with little sodium, protein or potassium load (such as in beer potomania) can inhibit protein breakdown and urea excretion, therefore decreasing daily solute excretion to &lt;250mOsm, which can result in hypoNa if fluid intake is increased.Correct at a rate of &lt;0.5mEq/L/h since she is no longer symptomaticQ6H lytes to ensure correct rate of correction &#8211; prevent osmotic demyelinationFluid restrict to 1L fluid/daySince she is euvolemic, no indication for NS repletionPatient refused nutrition consult to discuss dietary choices &#8211; clearly she is making poor dietary choices and her caloric intake is ~800-1000 kcal/day currently from food (+~1000kcal from soda)##: Protected fall &#8211; History is suggestive of fall in setting of electrolyte distribution and consequential lightheadedness.   Does not seem cardiac in origin, however Q waves in inferior leads appear to have progressed from last EKG on 2/20/67.  Protected fall argues against acute arrhythmic event.Check orthostaticsWill check cardiac enzymes as EKG is suggestive of progressive Q waves in inferior leads.Monitor on telemetry.Physical therapy consult.##: Anemia &#8211; Hct at baseline, however was iron deficit in 6/65 and had a tubular adenoma resection on colo.

Delta-delta is 8/6=1.3= Pure metabolic acidosis.  Osmolar gap is &lt;10 so ingestion is less likely.  There are no ketones in the UA and there is no evidence of renal failure.  pH is not suggestive of an acidosis.  AG is likely from severe metabolic disarray (decreased anions and cations).Check lactateRepeat AG##: Leukocytosis - no evidence of infection, although infection could contribute to confusion.

Adriana Buckley, NPb. 69162Record date: 2159-05-12CARDIOLOGYWISNER FAMILY PRACTICEFloyd R Shaw M.D. Mariners Hospital Internists6293 Brookside Terrace, Suite 626Grayling, ME 78726Dear Fitzgerald:  I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Haden Doty, in consultation today regarding his peripheral arterial disease and generalized vascular disease.  As you know, he is a patient that has known coronary artery disease, for which I ended up doing a catheterization on 08/27/2157, and that was done because of an abnormal stress test and chest pain.  At that time, he had been evaluated by Dr. Morgan Thayer, who performed a stress MIBI and demonstrated an inferoposterior ischemia, a low workload of 3 minutes and 18 seconds, and a heart rate of only 72% of predicted.  The LV chamber was dilated, and the ejection fraction was estimated at 48%, and there was a suggestion of global ischemia.  The catheterization demonstrated the presence of moderate diffuse coronary artery disease, plaque distributed throughout much of the coronary tree, some calcification, and narrow caliber vessels overall, but no focal high-grade stenoses.  There was some disease in the distal left main coronary artery, but his angina or ischemia was felt to be on the basis of excess demand in the phase of globally diminished supply.He was treated medically for the coronary artery disease.  At the time of his cath, he also underwent an angiography of his abdominal aorta and selective angiogram of his left leg, because he was complaining of claudication predominantly on the left calf at that time.  That study demonstrated the presence of two renal arteries of the left side, a small superior one that was narrowed by about 50%, and a larger inferior left renal artery that was narrowed by about 60%.  The right side was patent.  With respect to the abdominal aorta, there was an ulcerated plaque just below the superior renal artery, narrowing the channel in the aorta by about 30% or 40%.  The iliac vessels were patent, and the left common femoral artery had some irregularity that was patent.  The left SFA, a diffusely diseased vessel, had a high-grade stenosis of about 80% in the adductor canal.  Then, at the trifurcation, there was occlusion or high-grade stenosis of all three trifurcation vessels on the left side.  There was reconstitution at the level of the ankle.The decision at that time was made to treat him conservatively, at least for the present, since he was still playing golf three to four times a week.  He also apparently had some other issues, so I never saw him again in followup.  The original plan had been to bring him back for revascularization of his left renal artery and the left SFA.He did have back surgery about a year ago when he became significantly crippled by his lumbar spinal stenosis.  Dr. Anders Sykes performed an L3-L4, L4-L5 decompressive laminectomy.  This had a dramatically positive effect on his back pain.The biggest problem now is that he feels that he cannot walk as far and his exercise tolerance has decreased.  He has been an avid golfer in the past, but is now having some more difficulty with that.  Even when I saw him two years ago, he was using a cart to play three or four times a week.  He still is able to play golf, but if he walks about 100 yards, he starts feeling his calves, and now the symptoms are bilateral and equal.  He also has some numbness in his toes, which is constant, and his feet feel cold much of the time.  The symptoms of claudication have increased over the past couple of years.His blood pressure has been reasonably stable.  He tells me that you get pressures of 120-130.  He has not been taking his blood pressure at home, but he does take a fair amount of medication, see below.Of note, his son says that when he was in Michigan, he was playing 18 holes of golf regularly, sometimes a couple of times per day, but Haas notes that he was indeed limited by claudication even though he was able to play the golf down in Michigan.  He seems to be more limited up here since returning just a short time ago.  He also says that he feels like he has got to stay on the move, and if he does not play any golf at all, he will really deteriorate.  Of note, the discomfort is not only limited to the calves, but also there is some discomfort in the hips, though not nearly as bad and not as limiting.Of note, he has been seeing Dr. Youngman for his legs and has been told to \"walk walk walk.\"  At this point, he feels that he cannot walk as well or enough to follow through on his instructions.Past medical history:   As above.Others include the following:1.  Diabetes, type 2.2.  Hypertension, with blood pressures as high as 220 at times in the past.3.  Carotid bruits, though I do not have any readings from a Duplex ultrasound that was done a couple of years ago or so.4.  Hyperlipidemia.5.  Remote history of smoking, quit 40 years ago or so after 20 years of smoking.6.  Peripheral neuropathy.7.  Coronary artery disease, as described.8.  Renal artery stenosis and PVD.Current Medications:  Avandia 4 mg QD Prilosec 20 mg QD atenolol 150 mg QD Imdur 60 mg QD lisinopril 40 mg QD Lipitor 5 mg QD metformin hydrochloride 500 mg 4 tabs qd glyburide 5 mg 2 tabs qd aspirin 325 mg QD Tricor 54 mg 1 tab qd Norvasc 5 mg QD Plavix 75 mg QD nitroglycerin PRN Lasix 40 mg QDSocial history:   He used to run a catering company.  Currently retired.  Plays golf a lot.  Likes to maintain a high level of activity.  Has two sons, one in Lake Wildwood, another in Baldwin City.  He has a daughter in Michigan.  Grandchildren - several.  He also has a great grandchild.No smoking currently and only drinks occasional beer.  Occasional cup of coffee.Review of systems:   Positive for edema, 1+ in both legs.  He denies neurologic symptoms, sweats, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bloody stools, or hemoptysis.  He does have night cramps and frequent urination at night.  He says he has some problems with vision with some intermittent blurring of his vision, but no monocular blindness.  He is set up to see an ophthalmologist soon.Physical examination:-Pulse:   64 and regular-BP: 160/65    by my nurse, but I retook it at 130/60-General:   He is a well-appearing gentleman, looks younger than his age of 82 years-Heent:   Normal.  EOMI.  PERRL-Neck:   Carotid upstrokes normal.  Bilateral bruits present, soft.  No JVD-Chest:   Clear-Cardiac:   Normal S1 and S2, soft S4, and a grade 1-2/6 murmur in the left lower sternal border-Abdomen:   Soft, positive bruit, no organomegaly, and no enlargements of the aorta-Extremities:   Femoral pulses 2+, bilateral bruits.  Below this, feet are warm and well perfused, with 1+ edema bilaterally.  Trace pulses in the dorsalis pedis on both sides, not sure how well I am feeling them.  Popliteal pulses are trace to 1+.  No ulcers or gangrene.  No tissue lossEKG:    - normal sinus rhythm at 64.  Normal axis and intervals, very minor nonspecific ST-T wave abnormality, essentially normal tracing.Other Data:   Date of Birth:  01/22/2077Assessment and plan:   1.  Obtain MRA of abdominal aorta, renal, and run-off arteries down to the ankle.  This will help give us a road map as to how we can approach revascularization of his legs to make him feel better.  I already know that I can open up his left SFA and probably his left trifurcation vessels below the knee, but I would like to see the right side and also get another look at the aortoiliac vessels, since it has been a full two years.2.  Continue appropriate risk factor modification as you are doing.3.  We will obtain blood work today in preparation for revascularization.4.  I need to get carotid noninvasive studies, since it has been a couple of years anyway.Impression:   1.  Peripheral arterial disease - progressive claudication, now involving both legs at an equal amount and limiting him in terms of daily activities.  We know that he has high-grade disease in the left leg, below the groin, which can be treated.  Right leg has not been examined in the past.  Also has an ulcerative plaque in the aorta, which might be best left alone.2.  Renal vascular disease - known moderately severe stenosis left main and accessory renal arteries.  Blood pressure is under reasonable control.  Need to check his creatinine and BUN.  If they are okay, then we would leave him alone.  He is however on a total of six antihypertensive medications, so consideration of renal artery revascularization is certainly something to entertain.3.  Coronary artery disease - stable.4.  Diabetes.5.  Spinal stenosis - better since back surgery.Changes to Medications this visitAvandia 4 mg   QDPrilosec 20 mg   QDatenolol 150 mg   QDImdur 60 mg   QDlisinopril 40 mg   QDLipitor 5 mg   QDmetformin hydrochloride 500 mg 4 tabs  qdglyburide 5 mg 2 tabs  qdaspirin 325 mg   QDTricor 54 mg 1 tab  qdNorvasc 5 mg   QDPlavix 75 mg   QDnitroglycerin     PRNLasix 40 mg   QDThank you so much for allowing me to participate in the care of this nice gentleman.

The upper      renal artery is an accessory muscle and has a mild to moderate      stenosis at its origin.  The left renal artery has a high-grade      stenosis at its origin.  There is a circumaortic left renal vein.           There is a chronic penetrating ulcer with focal aortic dissection of      the visceral segment of the abdominal aorta.  There is a moderate      stenosis of the left common iliac artery origin.           The kidneys are unremarkable.           The liver, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are unremarkable.      There is no intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal adenopathy.           There is cholelithiasis.  The common bile duct is 2.1 cm in diameter      with a probable common duct stone.           There are no bony lytic or blastic lesions.           The visualized lungs are clear. There is centrilobular emphysema,      mild.  There are no pleural effusions.                IMPRESSION:           1.  Cholelithiasis with a dilated common bile duct and a common duct      stone.           2.  No significant mesenteric arterial compromise.  The IMA is      occluded.           3.  Stenosis of both left renal arteries, with the larger left renal      artery severely stenotic.           4.  Mild to moderate stenosis of the right renal artery.           5.  Chronic penetrating ulcer with focal dissection of the distal      segment of the abdominal aorta.      5/30/63 CAROTID US:IMPRESSION1. Bilateral moderate 50-69% stenosis of the internal carotid arteries.2. &lt; 50% stenosis noted in the distal left common carotid artery.3. No significant stenosis in the left external carotid artery.4. Probable hemodynamically significant stenosis in the right external carotid  artery.4. Antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.5. Normal flow in both subclavian arteries.PREVIOUS ENDOSCOPIC EVALUATIONS:Per the patient and his sons he was evalueated &gt;10 yrs ago w/ a colonoscopy which noted a single small benign polyp.ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN:87M h/o CAD (3vd), PVD, DM, HTN moderate b/l carotid stenosis, chronic ulcer in the distal ulcer w/ dissection, w/ a dilated CBD and choledocholithiasis for which we are consulted.We will plan for further evaluation of the patient&#8217;s biliary system with an ERCP. Given the location of the largest stone i.e. not impacted with very slight LFT derangement I am concerned for alternative sources of the patient&#8217;s biliary dilation (e.g. pancreatic ca).I have spoke to the patient and his 2 sons that given his numerous comorbidities in particular his cardiac status and carotid disease that he is at higher risk for complications which they all appreciate.Recommendations:-cont cipro/flagyl, if any concerns for decompsenation would add ampicillin also-IVF-clear liquids ok until midnight-NPO from midnight-neurology consult for risk of GA given carotid artery disease burden-please confirm with vascular surg ERCP/GA safe given dissection/aortic ulcer present-patient waitlisted for ERCP w/ GA on 6/27/64_______________________Yash Ugarte, MD, PhDGI Fellow, pager 47860\n",

In addition, I personallyinterviewed and examined this patient.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old female whopresents for evaluation of chest pain.  The patient had nohistory of coronary artery disease until the last week.  She wasapparently in Pennsylvania where she had been for the last week.  Shehad been having 5 days of epigastric and substernal discomfort. She considered it to be indigestion and have been taking Tums. After approximately 5 days while in Pennsylvania, she felt that thediscomfort was not improving.  She did feel like that she hadless energy for her usual activity.  She went to a hospital therein her land of Pennsylvania where she was noted to have a positivetroponin.  She underwent a diagnostic catheterization that didshow multivessel disease with an occluded LAD.  She subsequentlyunderwent a therapeutic PCI with stenting of her LAD.  She didhave recurrent chest pain today after catheterization, which wasmuch more severe, sharper in nature per her description.  She wastold in the hospital in Pennsylvania that this was due to reperfusion. She returned home today, called her primary care physician andwas advised to come to the Emergency Department for evaluation. She does state that since discharge from the hospital in Pennsylvaniaearlier this week, she has had intermittent episodes of moresevere left anterior chest pain, which she describes as somewhatmore sharp than the indigestion feeling she was experiencingbefore.  It is not always associated with exertion.  It sometimesradiates to her left shoulder.  It is not pleuritic in nature. It seems to be intermittent, although she does have a low levelof dull aching pain, which has been fairly constant since herdischarge from Pennsylvania.  She denies any shortness of breath.  Sheis able to lie flat.  Denies any lower extremity edema.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Positive for type 1 diabetes, which isfairly brittle per her report.  She is status post MI within thelast week.  She also has a remote history of PE in the past andis no longer on Coumadin.SOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke.  She lives with her husbandand has recently returned from Pennsylvania.FAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and is also positive for CAD.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  All other systems are reviewed and are alsonegative except per the HPI.MEDICATIONS:  Include insulin, Plavix, aspirin, Nexium, Lipitor,and atenolol.ALLERGIES:  The patient has allergies to iodine and Indocin.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her temperature is 98.6, her pulse 65,respirations 18, and blood pressure 105/69.  The patient isawake, alert, pleasant female who is reclining in no acutedistress.  Her head examination is normocephalic and atraumatic. Her pupils are equal and reactive to light.  Her sclerae areanicteric.  Her conjunctivae are pink and moist.  She has moistmucous membranes and appears well hydrated.  Her neck is suppleand nontender with full range of motion.  The JVP is notelevated.  Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally withequal breath sounds, no respiratory distress.  No accessorymuscle use and no chest wall tenderness.  Her cardiac examinationis regular rate and rhythm with no murmur, rub, or gallop.  Herabdomen is nondistended, soft, and nontender.  No guarding, noperitoneal signs, and no organomegaly.  Her skin is intact, warm,dry, and slightly pale.  There are no rashes.  Her back isnontender with full range of motion.  Extremities reveal nocyanosis, clubbing, or edema.  Her calves are soft and nontenderwith no palpable cords and full range of motion with normalstrength and tone.  She is alert and oriented x3, very pleasant. Cranial nerves are intact, and there is no motor or sensorydeficit.  Rectal examination performed by the resident revealsheme-negative stool with normal tone.EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was placed on a cardiacmonitor.  IV access was maintained.  Laboratory studies were sentand EKG was also ordered.  Her prior records from Pennsylvania werereviewed.  Her white blood cell count is 8.4, hematocrit 37, andplatelets 285,000.  Her electrolytes are within normal limits. Her BUN is 18, creatinine 0.8, and glucose 112.  Her CK herereturned normal at 33.  Her MB was 0.4.  Her troponin returnedelevated at 0.39.  This is in comparison to the troponin from herrecords of Pennsylvania, which was 0.2.  Her d-dimer is less than 200. Her INR is 1.1.  The patient had an EKG, which showed evidenceof a new T-wave inversions, present on prior EKG from thishospital.  She was started on heparin for concern of unstableangina status post MI, remained hemodynamically stable, and isadmitted to the Cardiac Service.DIAGNOSIS:  Chest pain, rule out unstable angina.______________________________CONNER, VICKIE M.D.D: 11/08/85T: 11/08/85Dictated By: CONNER, VICKIEeScription document:6-4710513 BFFocus ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********Record date: 2085-12-07ZASTROW, IRENE4252158312/07/2085DATE OF ADMISSION:  12/06/2085.This 66-year-old woman phoned my office complaining of exertional chest discomfort.  We instructed her to presented to the Emergency Department at Davis Monthan Hospital.  She had experienced multiple episodes of chest pressure with exertion lasting 5-10 minutes and radiating to her left axilla.On 10/30/2085, she suffered non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction in Pennsylvania and was managed with percutaneous coronary intervention.Chest discomfort recurred and on 11/03/2085, she was recatheterized at Davis Monthan Hospital where her mid LAD stent was expanded.She has had worsening substernal chest discomfort over the past two to three days.  Her discomfort is relieved with nitroglycerin.  Overnight, she had on and off chest discomfort with anterior T-wave lability.  She was placed on intravenous heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin.She suffered pulmonary embolism in 2074.   That is when I first met her.  She has gastroesophageal reflux disease.She is married; her husband works at 24 Hour Fitness as a personal trainer in the weight room.  She does not smoke cigarettes.  She has four children.Home medications include aspirin 325 mg daily, atenolol 25 mg daily, Lipitor 80 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, insulin, and sublingual nitroglycerin as needed.The review of systems is negative other than the above.On physical examination, she appears well.  Afebrile, blood pressure 126/82 mmHg, heart rate 72 and regular, and respiratory rate 13 per minute.  HEENT is normal.  The neck veins are not distended.  The chest is clear.  On cardiac examination, she has a regular rhythm with a normal S1, single S2, and no murmur, rub, or gallop.  Abdomen has no masses or hepatomegaly.  The legs have no clubbing or cyanosis, but there is right leg greater than left leg edema.  The skin has no rash.My assessment is that Irene Zastrow has \"small vessel\" coronary artery disease in addition to epicardial coronary artery disease.  We will intensify her medical regimen by prescribing higher doses of beta blockade and by initiating a long-acting nitrate.  We will also repeat the chest CT scan to make sure she has not suffered from recurrent pulmonary embolism.I discussed this plan with her, her husband, and the medical house staff.______________________________Victor Z.

At that time, she had a drug-eluting stent placed in her left anterior descending coronary artery.  On 11/03/2085, she had repeat percutaneous coronary intervention because of persistent chest pain and required an additional inflation and reexpansion of the drug-eluting stent.  On 12/07/2085, she had repeated cardiac catheterization because of chest pain but no additional percutaneous coronary intervention was required.She feels that she is having less chest discomfort as we have \"ramped up\" her cardiac medications.  She has no shortness of breath.  She does get occasional abdominal pulsations.  She does get epigastric discomfort.Current medications include ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily, aspirin 325 mg once daily, Plavix 75 mg once daily, isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg once daily, Lipitor 20 mg daily, and insulin.The review of systems is negative other than the above.On physical examination, she appears well.  Weight 165 pounds, blood pressure 109/73 mmHg, heart rate 77 and regular, respiratory rate 14.  HEENT:  Normal.  The neck veins are not distended.  The chest is clear.  On cardiac examination, she has a regular rhythm with a normal S1, single S2, and no murmur, rub, or gallop.  Abdomen has no masses or hepatomegaly.  The legs have no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  The skin has no rash.Irene Zastrow is improving from the clinical cardiovascular view point.I will obtain an exercise treadmill test using the standard Bruce protocol to obtain additional objective data.Although theoretically she should not have acid secretion due to pernicious anemia, I do suspect she has acid reflux, and I am reinstituting today Prilosec 20 mg twice daily.I am prescribing physical therapy for her \"stiff neck.\"I am ordering an abdominal ultrasound to exclude abdominal aortic aneurysm due to her complaint of episodic abdominal severe pulsations.I reassured her and told her she is clinically improving.  I will plan to see her again in about four months.Best personal regards.Sincerely yours,______________________________Victor Z.

We have had heron the insulin pump now for close to six months and recently she had had continuous blood glucose monitoring.  We had gone over these results over the phone and I had made some adjustments.  Particularly she seems to have some late morning hyperglycemia and we decided to change her carbohydrate to bolus ratio during the morning hours and this has resulted in tremendous improvement in her blood sugars.  She brings them in today and the results look excellent.  She has had no other concerns of late.  We have not tested her hemoglobin A1c in a long period of time, so she comes in today for further evaluation.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for the type I diabetes as described, her pernicious anemia, C6-C7 vertebral degenerative disease, pulmonary embolus and also some mild asthma in the past.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Prior surgeries are complete hysterectomy about 15 years ago and a single oophorectomy.  Prior hospitalizations include her PEs in 2083, her tachycardia in 2083.  She had arthroscopic right knee surgery approximately five years ago and she had four live births.  She is currently in menopause.MEDICATIONS:  Include Aleve 220 mg b.i.d. p.r.n. pain, aspirin 81 mg daily, calcium 600 mg plus vitamin D, she takes one tablet twice a day, Plavix 75 mg daily, glucagon emergency kit as needed, glucosamine 750 mg b.i.d.  She has recently completed a Cipro course with Dr. Varney for bacterial overgrowth symptoms, Imdur 30 mg daily, Lipitor 20 mg nightly, multivitamin one tablet per day, ranolazine 1 g as directed, Toprol-XL 150 mg daily, vitamin B12 1500 mcg every month, and vitamin D2 1000 mg daily.ALLERGIES:  Include any iodine product she gets red and itchy skin.SOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke.

Paternal grandmother passed away at age 89 and paternal grandfather at 52 from a massive MI.  Paternal grandmother 53 from colon cancer, paternal grandfather at age 89.  She has four children ____ serious medical problems.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise unremarkable except for what is listed already in the HPI.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is generally awake, alert, in no acute distress.  She is 66.5 inches with a weight of 167.5 pounds, which gives her a BMI of 26.7.  Her blood pressure is 110/62 and her pulse is 86.  Generally, she is awake, alert, in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Normocephalic and atraumatic.  Pupils equally round and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  Cranial nerves II through XII are symmetric and intact bilaterally.  Fundi are unremarkable.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No dullness to percussion is present.  Back exam reveals no spinal, paraspinal or CVA tenderness.  Breast examination reveals no masses or galactorrhea.  Cardiovascular exam, PMI in the mid clavicular line, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdominal exam:  Normoactive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly or abdominal masses noted.  Anoscopy did not reveal any hemorrhoids.  Neck exam reveals no jugular venous distention.  Carotids are 2+ with normal upstrokes.  Thyroid is 20 g without nodules.  Extremities are without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Neurologically, she is alert and oriented x3 and has a grossly nonfocal exam.ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:1.  Ms. Zastrow is a 67-year-old woman who comes in today with review of her type 1 diabetes.  She is doing much better on the pump than she was before especially with the recent adjustments we made.  We will continue with the pump and she will continue to send me her blood sugars every two weeks until we get this under control.  We will check a hemoglobin A1c today.  She is up-to-date with the remainder of her health maintenance including seeing a podiatrist and an ophthalmologist as we had prescribed.2.  Cardiovascular.  She is doing well on her current regimen.  She is on ranolazine and will continue with this.3.  Neck pain.  Intermittent neck pain is most likely from degenerative disease.  I did not find anything on neurological exam that was concerning.  I did encourage her to actually take some Naprosyn as needed for this pain, but not to take it on a continuous basis for long periods of time.  She has had some problems with some blood in the stool and I feel that she is due for colonoscopy.  I did recommend that she get one in the near future.  ADDENDUM:  A pelvic exam was with normal appearing female external genitalia.  Normal vaginal vault, no adnexal fullness felt.  Vaginal Pap was taken.  Greater than 50% of our 60-minute visit was spent going over her pump settings, the appropriate levels for her pump, going over her diet, going over her bowel habits and her etiology of possible blood in her stool.______________________________Iva P Hall, MDeScription document:9-9269277 CSSten TelDD: 04/19/87DT: 04/19/87DV: 04/07/87\n",
